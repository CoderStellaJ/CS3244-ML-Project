Blind people voice guide app

### App features
- GPS location share 
  <br/>location is shared to family to ensure blind people's safety in case of emergency.
- Camera based image capturing 
  <br/>capture real-time view in front of the user.
- Object detection
  <br/>focus on human object
- Moving direction determination
  <br/>based on bounding box size in sequencial images to determine whether the peron is moving to/away from the user.
- Voice Guide
  <br/>based on object classification and moving direction, output audio guide (a person is moving to you/ a person is moving away from you)
